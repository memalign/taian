This will not impact where your insurance materials are sent, but is needed to verify your card.\n\n-Some banks need to be notified in advance when you make a credit card charge outside your home country - you may need to call the number on the back of your card to tell them this is a genuine charge.\n\nLet me know if you would like assistance.\n\nThanks for your business.\n\nCustomer Service\ntaianfinancial.com\n317-318-8258 (Chinese)\n317-318-8259 (English)\n\n'] = "\n\nDear \[客户姓名\]\n\n我们的系统显示您试着购买我们的国际医疗保险，但您的信用卡付款没有成功，所以您的保险没有生效。\n\n 信用卡付款失败的常见原因如下：\n\n-有时账单地址很难翻译。您可以将您的中文地址输入\"Google Maps\"中搜索，\"Google Maps\"就会给出您的地址的英文翻译。您需要核对\"Google Maps\"翻译的准确性。通常这个方法会很有帮助。\n\n-用信用卡付款时需要填写账单地址。账单地址是您接收信用卡账单的地址。填写正确的账单地址是为了用来确认信用卡，不会影响您的保单或购买保险的收据的邮寄地址。\n\n-信用卡被国外公司扣款时，有些银行需要事先通知。您可能需要给您的银行打电话，通知他们您的信用卡会被国外保险公司扣款。\n\n如需帮助请告知。\n\n非常感谢您的信任和支持！\n\nCustomer Service\ntaianfinancial.com\n317-318-8258 (Chinese)\n317-318-8259 (English)\n\n";
