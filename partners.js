Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and three deductible options) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit and deductible not over $500) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements.

Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and $500 deductible) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit and $500 deductible) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements.  You can also choose Taian Plan B with a higher benefit or Taian Plan A if you need more benefits than your school requires.

Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and three deductible options) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit and deductible not over $500) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements. You can also choose Taian Plan B with a higher benefit or Taian Plan A if you need more benefits than your school requires.

You can send the confirmation letter to your school as proof of insurance."));

These requirements are the same as the US Department of State. Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and three deductible options) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit and deductible not over $500) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements. You can also choose Taian Plan B with a higher benefit or Taian Plan A if you need more benefits than your school requires.

You can send the confirmation letter to your school as proof of insurance."));
