These requirements are the same as the US Department of State. Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and three deductible options) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit and deductible not over $500) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements.

You can also choose Taian Plan B with a higher benefit or Taian Plan A if you need more benefits than your school requires.

Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and three deductible options) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit and deductible not over $500) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements.

Repatriation of remains of $7,500; 3. Medical evacuation of $10,000; 4. Deductible not over $500 per accident or illness.  Taian Plan B with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury and three deductible options is the most affordable plan that meets the requirements. You can also choose Taian Plan B with a higher benefit or Taian Plan A if you need more benefits than your school requires. After submitting an application online successfully, you will receive an Email in a few minutes which contains your insurance ID card and your confirmation letter (Visa Letter). You can send the confirmation letter to your school as proof of insurance.");
