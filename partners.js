Medical evacuation of $10,000; 4. Deductible not over $500 per accident or illness. These requirements are the same as the USDOS. Taian Plan B (with $50,000 benefit per illness or injury, deductible not over $500) and Plan C (with $50,000 benefit, deductible not over $500) are the most affordable plans that meet the requirements. You can also choose Taian Plan B or Plan C with a higher benefit if you need more benefits than your school requires.

You can send the confirmation letter to your school as proof of insurance.");
