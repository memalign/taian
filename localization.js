You can try putting your billing address in your native language into google maps and have it translated to English.  When address is a problem this usually helps.\n\n-When IMG asks for billing address, you need to fill in the address that your credit card bill is sent.  This will not impact where your insurance materials are sent, but is needed to verify your card.\n\n-Some banks need to be notified in advance when you make a credit card charge outside your home country - you may need to call the number on the back of your card to tell them this is a genuine charge.\n\nLet me know if you would like assistance.\n\nThanks for your business.\n\nCustomer Service\ntaianfinancial.com\n317-318-8258 (Chinese)\n317-318-8259 (English)\n\n'] = "\n\nDear \[客户姓名\]\n\n我们的系统显示您试着购买我们的国际医疗保险，但您的信用卡付款没有成功，所以您的保险没有生效。\n\n 信用卡付款失败的常见原因如下：\n\n-有时账单地址很难翻译。您可以将您的中文地址输入\"Google Maps\"中搜索，\"Google Maps\"就会给出您的地址的英文翻译。您需要核对\"Google Maps\"翻译的准确性。通常这个方法会很有帮助。\n\n-用信用卡付款时需要填写账单地址。账单地址是您接收信用卡账单的地址。填写正确的账单地址是为了用来确认信用卡，不会影响您的保单或购买保险的收据的邮寄地址。\n\n-信用卡被国外公司扣款时，有些银行需要事先通知。您可能需要给您的银行打电话，通知他们您的信用卡会被国外保险公司扣款。\n\n如需帮助请告知。\n\n非常感谢您的信任和支持！\n\nCustomer Service\ntaianfinancial.com\n317-318-8258 (Chinese)\n317-318-8259 (English)\n\n";
